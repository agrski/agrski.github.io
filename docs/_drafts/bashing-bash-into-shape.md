* Bash gets a bad rap
* It's ubiquitous and reasonably powerful
* Just needs a few tweaks to make it more useful

* stty/key bindings settings to fix asymmetric behaviour
* Eternal history settings
* Supercharging with fzf
  * Mention my preferred settings, e.g. colours for command types
* Using `bashrc.d/...` style to organise config
  * Allows for selectively disabling settings if unneeded
  * Keeps things separated so not just one huge blob of a file
* A few neat tricks like `^.`, `^x-u`, etc.
