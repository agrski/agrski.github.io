This article is part of a series about [Seldon Core v2](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/tree/v2).

* Optional -- SCv2 can run outside k8s, or even in k8s but without CRDs
  * Nice to have as it manages k8s CRDs for a Kube-native experience
* Operators are a standard part of k8s-focused systems
* Multiple CRDs managed by it: models, pipelines, servers, experiments
* Adaptor between CRDs & SCv2
* Delegates management of models, pipelines, and experiments to SCv2 scheduler
  * Long-lived connection to schedulers over gRPC
* Manages server resources much more directly
* Single operator for all resources, with one controller per resource
* No persistent state, as is standard for operators
* Mention generation of CRDs with controller-gen (& Kustomize?)
* Interesting use of CRs that define other CRs in the form of the `SeldonRuntime` resource
* Operator can be global, with runtimes namespaced
  * Can also be namespaced
